    <h1>What is the purpose for a forum dedicated for online learners?</h1>
    <p>We are an online learning platform whose main aim is to promote learning based not 
        only on structure but also your interests.
        Here, one would have access to a wide range of courses and the necessary 
        materials, but also an active and enthusiastic 
        peer group who share common interests and goals.
        Moreover to help you develop your interests further, we have discussion forums and 
        study-material exchange plans which have proved to be very effective.
